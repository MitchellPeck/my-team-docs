# Questions

The questions page allows coaches to view their currently used questions, remove current questions, add from available questions, and create custom questions. Hovering over a question and selecting the x will remove it. Hovering over a question and selecting the + will add it.



You can also add Headers and Descriptions. Just select that in the "Content type" dropdown, and whatever you put in the "Name" field will be the content.
