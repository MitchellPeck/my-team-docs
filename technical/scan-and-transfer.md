# Scan & Transfer

Scan & Transfer is a feature that allows you to transfer data from an offline device to an online device using QR codes. Note that this feature is still under development, and the scanning feature is only available on computers using the web app.

From the offline device's end, when your [Data Transfer Method](data-transfer-methods.md) is set to 'Scan & Transfer', you'll be able to click 'Generate Code to Scan' on the [Scouting Dashboard](../scouting/scouting-dashboard.md). This will take you to the Data QR Codes page, where you can present QR codes to the online device for scanning. Once finished scanning responses for either scouting or match data, click the 'Clear & Remove' button to remove the data from your device. The data type will automatically switch to the other option (Scouting Data or Match Data), and you'll be able to finish scanning. Make sure to click the 'Clear & Remove' button again once finished scanning the second time.

From the online device's end, when your [Data Transfer Method](data-transfer-methods.md) is set to 'Automatic - WiFi', you'll be able to click 'Scan QR Code' on the [Scouting Dashboard](../scouting/scouting-dashboard.md). This will take you to the Scan QR Codes page.

This feature is still in development. As of right now, there is no camera view. You'll need to open an app like Photo Booth (Mac) or Camera (Windows) to determine where to place your phone to scan the QR code. The message will tell you the status of your scans. Note that the message won't always be correct. If it gives you an error saying the data has already been uploaded, that most likely means that the data has been successfully scanned and uploaded, the QR code was immediately scanned again, and won't upload because it's the same data.
