# Event Progress

The Event Progress section allows you to select an event, and a match within the event to view the status of.&#x20;

On the left side, from top-down, is the following:

* Blue 1 previous alliance score w/match number and alliance color
* Final Blue alliance score
* Blue 2 previous alliance score w/match number and alliance color

On the right side, from top-down, is the following:

* Red 1 previous alliance score w/match number and alliance color
* Final Blue alliance score
* Blue 2 previous alliance score w/match number and alliance color

The image has multiple overlayed elements. They include:

* Team name and placement
* Pixel/prop randomization position

These elements display differently depending on certain conditions.

The team name and placement element has the following displays:

* If the team has auto, their badge has a gold outline
* If the team does not have auto, their badge has a black outline

The pixel/prop randomization position element has the following displays:

* If the team used a custom prop, the badge has a 'C' in the center
* If the team used a pixel, the badge has nothing in the center
* If the team successfully placed a pixel on the prop, the badge has a gold outline
* If the team did not place a pixel on the prop, the badge has a black outline

Clicking the previous alliance score next to a team will take you to the [Responses](../coach/responses.md) page, and automatically apply a filter to both tables to display only results for the chosen team.
