# Scouting Forms

The scouting forms allow you to collect data about other teams - whether for scouting or match data. Depending on which form you're on, your questions will look different.

You don't need to complete all questions, although keep in mind that your coach likely added the question because they wanted you to answer it. After completing a form, click the 'Save' button at the bottom. Your responses will be saved to your device, and you'll be taken back to the [Scouting Dashboard](scouting-dashboard.md) where your data will be handled depending on your [Data Transfer Method](../technical/data-transfer-methods.md).
