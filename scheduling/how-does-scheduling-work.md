# How does Scheduling work?

Scheduling allows you to configure a loop of events. These events can be scouting various alliances at different fields, breaks, pit work, or whatever you want them to be.

At the top of the scheduling page, you'll see a box with 'Current Task' and 'All Tasks' in it. Your team members will see this, too. This tells them what task they're on, and allows them to progress tasks.

The idea behind the scheduling functionality is that you have a customizable, looped list of tasks. You then assign your users to start at different points in the loop. For example, one user might start at 'Scout Field 1 Red', while another might start at 'Break'. Your users can then use the 'Next' button to progress tasks, and when they get to the last task, it loops back up to the top of the list. This way, instead of mapping out a task for every event and every user, you can setup a general list of looping tasks, and then assign users to start at certain tasks.

When planning your scheduling, keep in mind the end result for your users. Scheduling is built to revolve around match numbers, so make sure that the task loops keep this in mind. If you know how many matches are at an event, i.e. 32, maybe you only configure 8 looping tasks.

The Management and User Assignments functionality is only available to managers. Those are covered in [Management](management.md) and [User Assignments](user-assignments.md).
