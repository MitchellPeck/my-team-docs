# User Assignments

User Assignments allow you to assign users to start at a certain point in the schedule loop.

By selecting a task from the dropdown next to a user, next time they login or rebuild their cache, their schedule will start them at that task. With that being said, make sure that your users don't rebuild their cache after advancing in the schedule, as their place will be lost and they'll be put back at the task that you specified for them to start at.
