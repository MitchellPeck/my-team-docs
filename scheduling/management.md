# Management

Schedule management allows you to add and remove tasks from the loop.

When adding a task, keep your users in mind. Keep it short and simple, so they can quickly check their schedule and immediately know what they need to do. You can delete a task at any time by clicking the 'Delete' button below the respective task.
