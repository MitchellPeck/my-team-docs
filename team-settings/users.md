# Users

We've made managing your team users as simple as possible.

Note that we've blurred user IDs in the image above for privacy reasons.

On the left, you'll see the user's name followed by their user ID in parentheses.

On the right, you'll see an X icon to remove the user from your team, as well as a manager icon. If the manager icon has a plus next to it, that means that the user can be added as a manager. If the user has a gear icon next to it, that means that they are a manager and can be removed from manager status.

On the bottom, you can enter user IDs to add them to your team.
