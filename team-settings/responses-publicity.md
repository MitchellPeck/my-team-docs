# Responses Publicity

A feature that we're very excited about is responses publicity. This feature allows you to share your team's responses with other teams.

On the settings page, you'll see a list of teams who you're sharing your responses with. To see any teams who are sharing their responses with you, go to Scouting -> Analyze Data, and at the top of the page a notification will tell you what teams are sharing their responses with you.

To manage what teams can see your responses, click the pencil icon next to 'Responses Publicity'. This will show you a list of all teams at the next event, and you can select 'Yes' next to teams that you'd like to share your responses with.
