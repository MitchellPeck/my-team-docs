# Scouting & Match Questions

By customizing your team's scouting & match questions, you're able to make sure you're only collecting the data you care about.

When you click the pencil next to one of the question lists, you'll see a popup that will allow you to manage questions.

By clicking the X next to a question, it will remove that question from your team. Using the up and down arrows moves the question up and down the list. The list order is reflected to your users when they're filling out the form.

Note that all questions are public. So, you can't edit question information, but you can create new questions. Any new questions that you make will be usable by other teams, as well.

To add a new question, just enter the name and select a type. Then click 'Create and Add', and it will be added to your team immediately.

If there's a question that's available that isn't in your team's question list, you'll see it with an 'Add' button next to it. When you click the 'Add' button, it will be added to the bottom of your teams question list.
