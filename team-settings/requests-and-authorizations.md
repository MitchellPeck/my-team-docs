If there are any users pending access to your team, you can approve or deny them from the main settings page. However, by clicking the pencil icon, you will see the following popup:

This popup allows you to create new authorization codes, and remove existing ones. These codes allow users to join your team without needing you to approve them. However, codes can only be used once. Just give one of these codes to one of your users when they sign up, and they can use it to be immediately added to your team.
